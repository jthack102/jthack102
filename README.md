- 👋 Hi, I’m @jthack102
- 👀 I’m co-founder of an AI Start-up attempting to solve some large issues within the HR Tech industry. Specifically around talent identification.
- 🌱 We are currently exploring methods of Neuro-Symnolic reasoning and iterations of NNs that can be more task oriented.
- 💞️ We would love to partner with people that are passionate about researching LLM training and system architectures that are highly adaptive and individualized without requiring constant and manual updating.
