- 👋 Hi, I’m @jthack102
- 👀 I’m co-founder of an AI Start-up attempting to solve some large issues within the HR Tech industry, specifically around talent identification.
- 🌱 We are currently exploring methods of Neuro-Symbolic reasoning and iterations of NNs that can be more task-oriented.
  1. Developing a new foundational framework for search and discovery
  2. Developing " " for ranking and recommendation
  3. Exploring new processes regarding LLMs uses of semantic extraction
- 💞️ We would love to partner with people who are passionate about researching LLM training and system architectures that are highly adaptive and individualized without requiring constant and manual updating.
